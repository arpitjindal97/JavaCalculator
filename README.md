# JavaCalculator
This is my program of a Calculator. 
I have made two interface one is GUI and other is Command Line.
First you have to compile all the classes.

Then in order to run in GUI mode run the GUICalc class.
If you want to run it in Command Line then run calculator1 class.

My Calculate Class is the base and the core class of both the other classes.
